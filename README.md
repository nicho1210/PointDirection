# PointDirection
Point to where we go

Everytime when I set my destination on my phone
I would not know which direction to go, 
so I designed the small tools, which can always point at my destination's direction after I set my coordinate.

I used raspberry Pi, triaxial magnetic field, GPS, and serber motor mode, 
using my destination's coordinate which is input by me, 
and using triaxial magnetic field to check the direction, 
what's more, it can utilize the GPS to read the current location and
try to convert the coordinate between 2 places to get the angle,
at the end, using the sever motor to change the arrow's way to tell which direction to go to.
